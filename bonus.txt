The UCB1 algorithm is a better implementation plan for this problem because it balances exploration and exploitation using a principled approach grounded in confidence bounds. 
Unlike Îµ-Greedy, which relies on random exploration, UCB1 selects arms based on both average reward and uncertainty, reducing regret over time. 
It is deterministic, avoids tuning hyperparameters like epsilon, and adapts efficiently to changing reward estimates, making it ideal for maximizing long-term rewards in multi-armed bandit scenarios like ad selection.
